<body>
    <h1>Here is a list of what should be done and what should be avoided at a GD</h1>
    <p>
        <li>Be as natural as possible. Do not try to be someone you are not. Be yourself. </li>
        <li>Sit in a straight and confident posture. </li>
        <li>Be assertive yet humble. You need to stick to your values and beliefs, but learn to respect the values and
            opinions of others too. </li>
        <li>Grab the opportunity to speak first, i.e. to start the group discussion with your opinion. It generally
            leaves a good impression on the evaluator, but take the move only if you have complete knowledge of the
            subject. </li>
        <li>Do not repeat a point, or be lengthy or irrelevant. Also intervene, if someone else is going on an
            irrelevant track. </li>
        <li>Facilitate contribution from others. Do not just go on and on and on with only your opinionated view.
            Remember, it is a group discussion. Allow others to speak too. </li>
        <li>Make an eye contact with all the participants. It creates more room for conversation. Also keep nodding,
            when others speak, it shows receptivity. </li>
        <li>Be an active and dynamic participant. The examiner wants to hear you speak. </li>
        <li>Be positive and prepare your thoughts well but do not be over-confident. </li>
        <li>Think well before you speak. You are being heard and judged upon. </li>
        <li>When raising an objection to a point kept by another speaker, back it up with a solid reason to get the
            point across. </li>
        <li>Use quotes, facts and figures, statements, everyday life examples to express a clear chain of thoughts. Also
            it might leave a good impression on the examiner and help you score well.</li>
