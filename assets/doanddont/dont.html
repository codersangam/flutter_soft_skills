    <h1>Interview Dont's</h1>
    <p>
        <li>Shabby and casual dressing. </li>
        <li>Reaching late for interview. </li>
        <li>Lies and false facts. </li>
        <li>Arguments and debates. </li>
        <li>Don't make excuses. Take responsibility for your decisions and your actions. </li>
        <li>Don't make negative statements about yourself. Don't apologize or talk about what you don't have in your
            background. [Do focus on the positive.] </li>
        <li>Don't treat the interview casually, as if you are just shopping around or doing the interview for practice.
            This is an insult to the interviewer and to the organization. </li>
        <li>Don't give the impression that you are only attested in an organization because of its geographic location.
        </li>
        <li>Don't give the impression you are only interested in salary; don't ask about salary and benefits issues
            until the subject is brought up by your interviewer. </li>
        <li>Don't make the interviewer guess what type of work You are interested in; it is not the interviewer's job to
            act as a career advisor to you. </li>
        <li>Don't go to extremes with your posture; don't slouch, and don't sit rigidly on the edge of your chair. Don't
            chew gum or smell like smoke. </li>
        <li>Don't allow your cell phone to ring during the interview. (If it does, apologize quickly and ignore it)
            Don't pick up a calls or view text messages. </li>
        <li>Don't bite your fingernails. Don't touch your face or hair or adjust your clothing</li>
