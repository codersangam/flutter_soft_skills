        <p>- Give a brief of your education background (up to plus two is fine and location, any of your hobbies
            (Speak continuously for 2-3 minutes).</p>
        <p>- You can also mention one of your achievements, if it fits the circumstance.</p>
        <p>- Keep the answer to just about 3 4 sentences and not more than that. </p>
        <p>- A common mistake seen in most HR interview is to start the sentence like "I am basically from..." No
            need to start a sentence like that. Keep the answer simple, to the point and give space and time for
            further questions. Do not stretch it too much</p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>Start with your name </p>

        <p>Education in short </p>
        <p>Family details in short </p>
        <p>Hobbies or interests </p>

            advance my technical knowledge and skills by working in a dedicated manner in your organization. In the long
            run I would like to cement myself in a reputed position in your organization which would be mutually benefit
            myself and the organization. </p>

        <li><b>What are your strengths? </b></li>
        <p>This is another most common question in any HR interview. The idea here is to understand how much you know
            about yourself and how confident you are about your strengths. </p>
        <p>- Just stay positive. Even a simple answer like "I am a very positive person" is good enough. </p>
        <p>- You can also change this as per the requirement , of the interview. Knowing a bit about the profile you are
            being interviewed helps as well. </p>
        <p>- Explaining your strength with an experience from the past is desirable here. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>Hard working </p>
        <p>Positive attitude </p>
        <p>Creative </p>
        <p>I have excellent communication skills </p>
        <p>Fast learner </p>
        <p>I am a team player</p>
        <p>Boldness</p>
        <p>Friendly attitude</p>

        <p>Flexible</p>
        <p>Optimistic</p>
        <p>Self-Motivated</p>

        <li><b>What is your Weakness? </b></li>
        <p>This is a tricky question. The expectation here is to answer a negative trait with a positive twist.
            Something which in general is a weak point of a person, but is alright from an organizationâ€™s perspective.
        </p>
        <p>- Straightforward </p>
        <p>- I don't give up. </p>
        <p>- Emotional Person </p>
        <p>- More Talkative </p>
        <p>- Take decision very quickly etc. </p>
        <p>Add one sentence after you told your weakness " I am working on it". </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>"I tend to try to take up too many things, leaving little time for myself." </p>
        <p>"I am a perfectionist and sometimes, concentrate too much on one single task to get it to perfection, using
            up time from other tasks". </p>

        <li><b>Why should I hire you? </b></li>
        <p>As a fresher, you can't commit to any expertise in any specific domain. So, this question is intended to
            understand what quality of yours will be helpful most for the company. Knowledge about company and what
            quality of yours suits the organization, is the key to answer this. In case you don't much about the
            company, quick few abilities, flexibility, team player etc. are row common qualities that will fit any
            organizational needs.
        </p>
        <p>- Share your knowledge </p>
        <p>- Skills related to job </p>
        <p>- Career goals </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>I have had some internships and industry exposure. So being a fresher, it will still be easy for me to adapt
            to the new environment, which is significantly lessen my training cost. </p>
        <p>I have a sharp learning curve, which will help me become a productive resource as soon as possible An example
            of my learning curve is my final year project, where I have worked on a short time frame on an entirely new
            technology.</p>
        <p>I am a strong team player and good leader. I have been leading teams for technical and cultural activities
            during my college days. In your company I will be a great asset within any challenging team and provide
            leadership when opportunity arises. </p>

        <li><b>What do you know about our company? </b></li>
        <p>- Study about the company in detail.
        </p>
        <p>- Know the names of their owners and partners. CEO of India branch. </p>
        <p>- Research about the company's current Projects. </p>
        <p>- Update your knowledge about their competitors. </p>
        <p>- About awards received by the Company. </p>

        <li><b>What are your salary requirements? </b></li>
        <p>As a fresher you will usually not have much bargaining power in terms of salary. Still, you can ask the
            interviewer about the package they offer to fresher graduates. Most of the big companies have a fixed salary
            for each level and there will not be a room for much negotiation. However, if you are required to spell out
            a figure, offer a range rather than an exact figure.
        </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>As a fresher my first priority is to start my career in a reputed organization such as yours and through my
            work further extend my technical capabilities. Though salary is an important factor initially I would be
            satisfied with whatever is the company standards. I am sure down the road through my work I would be able to
            be in a position to demand a salary that would justify my hard work and efforts. </p>

        <li><b>Where do you see yourself 5 years from now? </b></li>
        <p>The purpose of this question is to see if the candidate is ambitious enough to grow. Recruiting a candidate
            is a time consuming and costly affair so they also want to see if the candidate is over ambitious to stay in
            the company for long. </p>
        <p>- How long would you be committed to the organization? </p>
        <p>- Are there any immediate plans for you to move on? etc. </p>
        <p>- If you have an actual plan, explain it with reasoning. </p>
        <p>- If you do not have any specific plans as of then, give a generic answer along with some interesting
            activity you would like to take up. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>"I would like to see myself donning one of the senior positions--.in the organization contributing to
            technology as well as participating in business growth. I am hoping, I can position myself with relevant
            experience by then." </p>
        <p>As a fresher, I am assuming that first five years will be a huge learning curve. I want to absorb much of the
            industry knowledge and also to sharpen my technical abilities. In next five years I see myself playing
            various roles in the team from a developer to leading a team. </p>

        <li><b>What are your hobbies and interests? </b></li>
        <p>You cannot say, you don't have any other interests, other than academics. A company for a candidate who are
            more rounded and keeps diverse interests in life. Identify one of our interests other than academics and
            prepare answer based on that (Don't include eating, watching TV, sleeping etc.) </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>I love singing and I also play instruments like guitar. </p>
        <p>Outdoor sports are my interest. Specifically, cricket. </p>
        <p>I am a numismatist (coin/currency collector). I have been doing it since school days. </p>

        <li><b>Are you ready to relocate? </b></li>
        <p>Say yes only if you mean yes. The employer might be planning to recruit you for a position in some other city
            or might have a plan to shift you after some months. Giving them a false hope will not be good on your part
            professionally. </p>
        <p>As long as you do not have any compelling reasons, being a fresher, it is better to be ready for relocation.
            Today's IT industry works on global operation model, where they have offices located at several locations.
            These are staffed strategically, as per need and business requirement and there could be a need for your
            skills at a particular location. </p>
        <p>Being flexible enough to suit the staffing need of a company is a great advantage for a fresher and since
            most of fresher move around with less baggage (example: being single), it is easier for company to move them
            at short notice. Remember, this applies for a foreign country placement also. So, denying a relocation
            means, you are also saying "No" to an onsite opportunity as well. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>Yes, most definitely. I believe being at different locations helps me learn about new culture and people.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, I don't see a problem in relocation, always a better learning experience than being around with same
            environment and people". </p>

        <li><b>Do you wish to pursue higher education? </b></li>
        <p>This answer needs to be answered tactfully, they want to know whether you are going to stay for long or you
            are just there to use their training resources and then say goodbye in 6 monthsâ€™ time. If you are seriously
            considering higher education, itâ€™s wise to say sp. If you are unsure (may be â€“ may not be), your answer
            could be: </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>I am interested in higher studies, but not immediately. want to get started working and then look for higher
            education based on my experience and career progressions.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, but not immediately. I plan to take up part time studies, with either an MBA or an VLSI engineering
            masters, depending on which will be more beneficial for my line of work. </p>

        <li><b>Why do you want to work for us? </b></li>
        <p>In this, interviewer is trying to check how well you know about the company. Mention some good word about the
            company at the same time, try to align a strength of yours with the company vision or goal or working
            culture. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>Working for an organization, which has won best employer award multiple times itself is a motivating factor.
            Also, more importantly, I would like to start off my career at a place, which values ethical practices and
            encourages overall development of a person.
        </p>
        <p>I believe life is always a mix of hard work and fun. I find the work culture of "xyz" to carry the same
            principle. "Work hard... Party harder". What better way to start off my career at a place, where I will feel
            like home. </p>

        <li><b>What is one thing that you like about our company?</b></li>
        <p>Again, always know about the company before choosing your answer. A wrong line of answer could cost you the
            job itself. Like you go to a research Organization & talk about your partying habit, you most likely lose
            the chance to get through. Most likely one of the above answers applies here also. The difference is, you
            don't have to align this with your interests & strengths. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>Working for an organization, which has won best employer award multiple times, in itself is a motivating
            factor. But more importantly, I would like to start off my career at a place which values ethical practices
            and encourages overall development of a person.
        </p>

        <li><b>What are your expectations from your first job?</b></li>
        <p>You can always quote a simple vision or strategy which you like about the company. As a fresher, your most
            important expectation should be "To Learn" & this is what most companies expect from you. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>I want to learn a lot of new technologies, learn how the corporate world works, be part of a big energetic
            team and contribute to the projects, develop my soft skills and to prepare myself for tougher challenges in
            future.
        </p>

        <li><b>Do you have any questions to ask me? </b></li>
        <p>- Express thanks</p>
        <p>- If I get selected, what would be my role? </p>
        <p>- What and all technologies would be taught during training period?</p>
        <p>- Job location. </p>
        <p>- What would be the duration of Training? </p>
        <p>- Transport facility etc.</p>

        <li><b>What is the difference between confidence and over confidence?</b></li>
        <p>Confidence means good understanding about your strengths and over confidence is misunderstanding about your
            strengths. just a small difference if I say I am suitable for this job it's my confidence but if I say I am
            the only one suitable for this job it's my over confidence. Confidence is trusting yourself and over
            confidence means underestimating others. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>I say I can do this work it shows confidence and when I say only I can do this work is over confidence.
        </p>

        <li><b>What is the difference between hard work and smart work? </b></li>
        <p>There is nothing called as smart work or hard work. The approach to work should be to do every single task
            with utmost sincerity dedication and passion. </p>

        <li><b>How do you feel about working at nights and weekends? </b></li>
        <p>Honestly speaking, it is difficult to tune my mind to work at nights and weekends. But: </p>
        <p>- If there is a deadline of handing over project to the client, then I will definitely be there to do my
            work. </p>
        <p>- No problem in working nights and weekends because in my opinion, if we want to be successful then we should
            be honest in our duty, it is vital for everyone who wants a bright future.</p>

        <li><b>Can you work under pressure? </b></li>
        <p>Working under pressure is the opportunity to know about my ability and gaining confidence. Pressure is
            nothing it is just a task that shows our talent how we handle them, if we love our work, never one can feel
            any pressure. I can work under pressure because pressure gives more and more experience to handle any
            critical situation. </p>
        <p>Your answer towards this question should be positive. </p>

        <li><b>What are your short-term and long-term goals? </b></li>
        <p>My short-term goal is to work in a reputed organization like yours where I can enhance my technical skills
            and knowledge. My long-term goal is to see your company at top most position where I am one of the person
            responsible for that. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>My short-term goal is to get a position to use my knowledge I have. My long term is to be skilled and get a
            position for gained experience. </p>

        <li><b>What motivates you to do good job? </b></li>
        <p>Good work environment, challenging activities, appreciation, team work, and motivation helping hand of the
            colleagues and employees motivates to do a good work. </p>

        <li><b>How long would you expect to work for us if hired? </b></li>
        <p>As long as I have the career growth, job satisfaction, respect and a healthy environment I don't need to
            change my company. Everyone wants to make progress in life and even I do. As far as the company rewards me
            for my hard work, I would be a part of it. </p>

        <li><b>Describe your ideal company, location and job. </b></li>
        <p>My ideal company is a company which gives me a job security, appraisals, for my dedication to work and a
            platform to update my knowledge with modern trends. The location, where people are co-operative, that is my
            ideal location and the job which gives me self-satisfaction is my ideal job. </p>

        <li><b>What are your career options right now? </b></li>
        <p>My career option is to get a platform to exhibit my skill. If given an opportunity for me to work in your
            company, I would like to enrich my professional skill and will contribute myself for the growth of the
            company. </p>

        <li><b>Explain how you would be an asset to this organization? </b></li>
        <p>The value of the assets decreases as the time passes on, and I will be like a long-term investment of the
            company, where the value increases with in skills, experience, capability, talent, and good investment
            always gives best output. Hard work, discipline, determination and punctuality of an employee makes him an
            asset for the company. </p>

        <li><b>Would you lie for the company? </b></li>
        <p>On a personal note, I would not prefer lying. However, if a lie is harmless one and would benefit others to
            resolve a situation in a peaceful manner, I would opt for it. </p>

        <li><b>Who has inspired you in why? </b></li>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>- Father and Mother</p>
        <p>- Sports person</p>
        <p>- Film Stars</p>
        <p>- Great business people</p>
        <p>Give some examples why these personalities inspired you.</p>

        <li><b>What was the toughest decision you ever had to make? </b></li>
        <p>Choosing my stream in engineering because at that point of time I had inclination towards multiple streams of
            engineering. </p>

        <li><b>Have you considered starting your own business? </b></li>
        <p>As a fresher I don't think so. To become a successful businessman, first we must be a successful employee.
            Now I want to be a good employee by improving my skills. After that, based on my interest I will think about
            it. </p>

        <li><b>How do you define success and how do you measure up to your own definition? </b></li>
        <p>Success is neither a destination nor an achievement. It is a constant journey where we have to work hard,
            face obstacles with passion and with great deal of zeal which help us to attain and accomplish milestones in
            our life. </p>

        <li><b>Will you still work if you get 100 million USD? </b></li>
        <p>Money makes our life comfortable whereas satisfaction brings us happiness and living a happy life cannot be
            bought or sold, it can only be gained. </p>

        <li><b>How much do you rate yourself in the scale of 1 to 10? </b></li>
        <p>I will rate myself at 6 out of 10. As I am not a perfect person who can do wonders but I assure you if I get
            a chance to prove myself, I will surely add some more points in the scale of 10. Just answer 5 to 7 never be
            over confident. </p>

        <li><b>What has been your greatest achievement? </b></li>
        <p>Find out something from the near past that makes you proud of yourself. If you do not find an answer to this
            question in your professional or academic life, it is absolutely fine to offer an answer from your social
            life. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>I managed to save the life of an accident struck stranger by taking him to the hospital on time and donating
            a bottle of blood for him. This example demonstrates that you are a responsible person. </p>
        <p>Other than this if you have a major achievement related to your career or co-curricular activities you can
            mention that.</p>
        <p>Mention any other achievement if you have. </p>

        <li><b>Are you flexible with timings (if u have to work in shift)? </b></li>
        <p>This question yet again checks about your flexibility. If there is a genuine problem for you to work in night
            or early morning shifts, mention that. </p>

        <li><b>Are you an Introvert or Extrovert? </b></li>
        <p>Being on either of the extremes at work can be bad for you and the company. Your behavior at work should be
            as per the requirement. To answer this question, you can say something like: I behave as per the requirement
            of the situation. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>If I am representing the company at an event which requires me to talk to a lot of people, I become an
            extrovert. While if there is some serious issue under discussion, I think quietly and deeply on it. </p>

        <li><b>How do you feel about doing repetitive work? </b></li>
        <p>Any job you take up will have an element of redundancy and the interviewer wants to see if you get bored of
            it. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>I like to do creative work but I also know that any job has an element of redundancy. So, it is fine with me.
        </p>

        <li><b>If you face a problem with your own performance, what would you do? </b></li>
        <p>Your answer to this question signifies whether you can identify problems with yourself or not. </p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>If I see a problem with my own performance, I'll try to find out and analyze the factors behind it & work on
            each of them.
        </p>

        <li><b>Do you want to ask us something about the company? </b></li>
        <p>Not asking any questions back demonstrates lack of interest in the job, dullness or lack of research about
            the company. When you are asked this question, you can ask some interesting questions like the opportunities
