    <title>Body Language and Interview Behaviour</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Communication is not only through words but also how we communicate through our body language. It's easier to
        control the words coming out of your mouth than what your body is communicating.
    </p>
    <p>Interview skills and communication skills are not just about speech techniques and structures. Up to 60% of the
        impression that you make is through your body language. Whatever the reality behind this statement, it is
        undoubtable that the way you dress and behave at an interview will strongly influence the person who is looking
        at you, even if it is subconscious. </p>
    <p>To make a strong impression, there are a number of rules regarding correct body language that you need to reflect
        upon and adopt : </p>

    <li>Maintain a good posture</li>
    <p>If you are being interviewed at a table, make sure that you are not too close to the table. As a rule of thumb,
        your body language should be such that if you let your arms fall loosely on the table in front of you, they
        should fall with your elbows slightly outside of the table. If you elbows are actually on the table then you are
        too close. If your elbows are more than a few inches away (or you have to lean forward a lot to put your hands
        on the table) then you are too far away. For most people, the ideal distance between chest and table is about 4
        inches. </p>
    <p>Plant both feet onto the ground so that you remain stable; and put your hands on the table (people who place
        their hands below the table come across as having something to hide). Keep, yourself upright, with a slight
        slant forward and relax your shoulders. If there is no table (or only a low table) then simply rest your hands
        on your lap.
    </p>
    <li>Don't be afraid to "own the space"</li>
    <p>Just because you are under observation, it does not mean that you should recoil in a corner. It is okay to stand
        or sit with your legs slightly apart, and In fact, it is a sign of confident body language.</p>
    <li>Limit your hand and arm movement</li>
    <p>It is perfectly okay in your body language to move your arms and hands around, and if that is the way that you
        normally behave then don't try to become someone else. Your personality and enthusiasm are as important as
        everything else. However make sure that such movements do not become distracting and do not take the focus away
        from your face. To achieve this, make sure that your movements are limited and never higher than your chest, and
        not under the table. If there is no table, you can let your hands go as far down as your lap. </p>
    <p>If your hands go outside towards the left or right, your interviewers will follow them and may stop concentrating
        on you. If your hands go over chest level, you will most likely obscure your lips or eyes.
        If you have a tendency to fidget in a very distracting manner, intertwine your fingers and rest your hands on
        the table.
    </p>
    <li>Smile</li>
    <p>A nervous smile is better than no smile at all -no one wants to employ a grumpy person that looks miserable all
        of the time! Good interviewers will understand that you may be nervous and will make attempts to put you at
        ease. Make sure that you reward their efforts with an easy smile but don't overdo it - it is simply a reasonable
        attempt to engage with them.</p>
    <p>Smile lightly also when you are being introduced to other people in the interview room. With this body language
        you can build a good rapport. It is also perfectly acceptable to laugh if the situation warrants it (but avoid
        making jokes just for the sake of introducing a laugh into the conversation. You'll probably end up being the
        only one laughing which could be embarrassing!)
    </p>
    <li>Maintain eye contact</li>
    <p>If you do not make eye contact, you will come across insecure which is poor body language. If you stare at people
        too much, you will make them feel insecure. There are two situations here: either you are being interviewed by
        just one person, in which case you will have no choice but to look at them all the time; or you are being
        interviewed by more than one person. If this case, then look mostly at the person who is asking you the
        question, and occasionally glance aside to involve others (they will be grateful that you are trying to involve
        them into the conversation even if they have not asked that particular question). </p>
    <li>Adopt an appropriate tone of voice and pace</li>
    <p>If you are feeling confident and enthusiastic about the job, this will be reflected in the way you speak. Nerves,
        stress and pressure will have a negative impact, while confidence, enthusiasm and energy will come across
        positively. </p>
    <p>Interview nervousness affect people in different ways. Some people speak very softly or too fast, others become
        hesitant and leave long gaps between words. During the interview, try to imagine that you talking to someone you
        know fairly well, and speak in a relaxed and easy manner. If you need to pause to think about what you want to
        say next, it is fine to do so (one interview technique is to accept the offer of a drink before the interview
        which you can take a sip of whilst pausing to think about what to say next without making it too obvious! As
        mentioned above, you would need to weigh this up against the possibility of spills and a shaky hand!) It is
        preferable to take a pause than to use "ums" and “errs” as long as the pauses are not excessively long, in which
        case an interviewer may not realize when you have finished speaking. </p>
    <p>Do also bear in mind that along with the positive image that you will give by smiling appropriately during the
        interview, this will also come across in your tone of voice further enhancing how you can appear confident and
        relaxed. </p>
    <li>And relax...</li>
    <p>You can't spend all of your energy focusing on body language so once you have consciously tried to embed the key
        points, try to put it out of your mind. There is no point displaying positive body language if your answers are
        terrible! Bearing in mind that body language is a reflection of your level of confidence, it is important that
        you build your confidence up first through good preparation and then go to the interview relaxed. You will be
        surprised to know much of the above you can do naturally. </p>
    <p>Below are a number of negative traits and how your body language can give them away:</p>
    <li>Defensiveness: crossing your arms </li>
    <li>Disinterested/Boredom: tapping feet playing with your pen, looking down, slouching, rubbing the back of your
        head or neck </li>
    <li>Nervousness: fidgeting, twiddling thumbs, playing with your hair </li>
    <li>Arrogance/overconfidence: brisk and erect walk, hands clasped behind head </li>
    <li>Aggression: Postures such as hands on hips and pointing or wagging your index finger </li>
    <li>Doubt: rubbing eyes or nose </li>
    <li>Too informal: Slouching in your chair and not sitting upright.</li>
